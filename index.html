          Hot- or bed-headed student following the cybersecurity bachelor's
          programme at Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech). Nevertheless,
          I follow masters programme cryptography courses, as that's my passion.

          Will link some projects here if there are any publication worthy ones
          in the future. Certainly nothing from the past...

        <p>
          While I of course have taken plenty of notes over my time studying,
          sadly none of the notes are fluid enough to be worthy of uploading
          them...yet. Naturally, I cannot upload official materials either.
