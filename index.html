            Hot- or bed-headed student following the cybersecurity bachelor's
            programme at Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech).
            Nevertheless, I follow masters programme cryptography courses, as
            that's my passion.

            Will link some projects here if there are any publication worthy
            ones in the future. Certainly nothing from the past...

            While I of course have taken plenty of notes over my time studying,
            sadly none of the notes are fluid enough to be worthy of uploading
            them...yet. Naturally, I cannot upload official materials either.
